## Installation

To run application you need `EMIPLIB` library (for calls), which can be build with `CMAKE` or you can use prebuild libraries (I will put link later).
Put `libs` in `C:/` folder (or anywhere you want but don't forget to change path) and then add to your `.pro`-file following strokes:
```Cpp
INCLUDEPATH += C:\libs\jrtplib\include
INCLUDEPATH += C:\libs\jthread\include
INCLUDEPATH += C:\libs\emiplib\include\emiplib

LIBS += -L"C:\libs\jrtplib\lib" -ljrtp
LIBS += -L"C:\libs\jthread\lib" -ljthread
LIBS += -L"C:\libs\emiplib\lib" -lemiplib
LIBS += -lws2_32
```

## Message structure

**QBroadcastMessenger** uses the custom message structure described below:
- When you first appear in the net app sends **CONNECT** message (`sayHi()` method in `ConnectionManager` class) of the given form: ```EVMp_CONNECT_%username_length%_%username%```
- To notify other apps of you staying connected in the network app sends **ALIVE** message (`ping()` method in `ConnectionManager` class) of the given form: `EVMp_ALIVE_%username_length%_%username%`
- To send message to all the clients in the network app sends **SENDMESSAGE** message (`sendMessage()` method in `ConnectionManager` class) of the given form: `EVMp_SENDMESSAGE_%message_length%_%message%`

## Settings
